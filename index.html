            Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles originated in an American comic book
            published by Mirage Studios in 1984 in New Hampshire. The concept
            arose from a humorous drawing sketched out by Kevin Eastman during a
            casual evening of brainstorming with his friend Peter Laird. Using
            money from a tax refund together with a loan from Eastman's uncle,
            the young artists self-published a single issue comic intended to
            parody four of the most popular comics of the early 1980s: Marvel
            Comics' Daredevil and New Mutants, Dave Sim's Cerebus the Aardvark,
            and Frank Miller's Ronin.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Much of the Turtles' mainstream success began when a licensing
            agent, Mark Freedman, sought out Eastman and Laird to propose wider
            merchandising opportunities for the offbeat property. In 1986, Dark
            Horse Miniatures produced a set of 15 mm lead figurines. In January
            1988, they visited the offices of Playmates Toys Inc, a small
            California toy company who wished to expand into the action figure
            market. Development initiated with a creative team of companies and
            individuals: Jerry Sachs, ad man of Sachs-Finley Agency, brought
            together the animators at Murakami-Wolf-Swenson, headed by
            award-winning animator Fred Wolf. Wolf and his team combined
            concepts and ideas with Playmates marketing crew, headed by Karl
            Aaronian and then VP of Sales, Richard Sallis and VP of Playmates,
            Bill Carlson. Aaronian brought on several designers and concepteer
            and writer John Schulte and worked out the simple backstory that
            would live on toy packaging for the entire run of the product and
            show. Sachs called the high-concept pitch "Green Against Brick". The
            sense of humor was honed with the collaboration of MWS's writers.
            Playmates and their team essentially served as associate producers
            and contributing writers to the miniseries that was first launched
            to sell-in the toy action figures. Phrases like "Heroes in a Half
            Shell" and many of the comical catch phrases and battle slogans
            ("Turtle Power!") came from the writing and conceptualization of
            this creative team. As the series developed, veteran writer Jack
            Mendelsohn came on board as both a story editor and scriptwriter.
            David Wise, Michael Charles Hill, and Michael Reaves wrote most of
            the scripts, taking input via Mendelsohn and collaborating writer
            Schulte and marketing maven Aaronian.

            The miniseries was repeated three times before it found an audience.
            Once the product started selling, the show got syndicated and picked
            up and backed by Group W, which funded the next round of animation.
            The show then went network, on CBS. Accompanied by the popular
            Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 1987 TV series, and the subsequent
            action figure line, the TMNT were soon catapulted into pop culture
            history. At the height of the frenzy, in the early 1990s, the
            Turtles' likenesses could be found on a wide range of children's
            merchandise, from Pez dispensers to skateboards, breakfast cereal,
            video games, school supplies, linens, towels, cameras, and even toy
            shaving kits. The TV series would eventually reach it's end, only to
            be replaced by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2003 TV series a few
            years later, which would prove to become extremely popular, reaching
            an even broader fanbase than the previous series.

            On October 21, 2009, it was announced that cable channel Nickelodeon
            (a subsidiary of Viacom) had purchased all of Mirage's rights to the
            Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles property. Mirage retains the rights to
            publish 18 issues a year, though the future involvement of Mirage
            with the Turtles and the future of Mirage Studios itself is unknown.
            Nickelodeon has developed a new CGI-animated TMNT television series
            and partnered with fellow Viacom company Paramount Pictures to bring
            a new TMNT movie to theaters. The TV show premiered on Nickelodeon
            on September 29, 2012. The live action film, produced by Platinum
            Dunes, Nickelodeon Movies and Paramount Pictures, directed by
            Jonathan Liebesman and produced by Michael Bay, was released on
            August 8, 2014.

            Michelangelo. His name was originally misspelled "Michaelangelo" by
            Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman.
